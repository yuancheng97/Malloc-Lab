Main Files:

mm.{c,h}	
	Your solution malloc package. mm.c is the file that you
	will be handing in, and is the only file you should modify.

mdriver	
	The malloc driver that tests your mm.c file

traces
	Directory containing trace files that test your implementation. 

Makefile	
	Builds the driver

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************

fsecs		Wrapper function for the different timer packages
clock		Routines for accessing the Pentium and Alpha cycle counters
fcyc		Timer functions based on cycle counters
ftimer		Timer functions based on interval timers and gettimeofday()
memlib		Models the heap and sbrk function

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on the test traces:

	unix> ./mdriver

To run the driver on a particular test trace:

        unix> ./mdriver -V -f [name of trace file].rep

The -V option prints out helpful tracing and summary information.

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> mdriver -h

To hand in your project, preview your grade, and see it on the 
scoreboard, use:

        unix> make
        unix> make handin
